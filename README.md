<h1 align='center'>ignite-github-blog</h1>

My solution for the challenge project "GitHub Blog", where the objective was to fetch issues published by the user in one of his repositories and show them on screen as a blog. This challenge was proposed in the ReactJs module of [Ignite](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/ignite), a more than complete programming course offered by [Rocketseat's](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/).
